									<h3 class="major">Background</h3>
									<p>I first broke into the programming world with freelancing in 2017. I began by offering my skills to help local small businesses have an online presence. In most of my early days, I worked through a lot of trial and error by Googling answers to problems I would come across.</p>

									<p>Fast foward to 2020 and I decided to dive deeper into web development, so I enrolled in Lambda School, an online technology-learning platform, to further my skills. Currently I'm still a student, but so far I've loved my educational journey with Lambda, and I'm excited to see what kind of developer I will become down the road. Scroll down to see some of my latest projects!</p>

									<h3 class="major">Latest Projects</h3>
									<p>Click on my latest projects to see a GitHub repo of my code. These projects show my abilities with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as React, Redux, Styled Components, Node.js and Python.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Food Finder</h3>
											<p>This project was built by me and a team of fellow Lambda School students. It allows for app users to find food trucks in their area, and for the operators of those food trucks to broadcast their menu and location to hungry diners!</p>

											<h3 class="major">Whats Poppin</h3>
											<p>This app is for those who want to party! It allows for people to find local events and after approval, the user is given details of where to find the event. Again, this is a collaboration project built by me and a team of fellow Lambda School students.</p>
